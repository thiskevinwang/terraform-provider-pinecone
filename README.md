# terraform-provider-pinecone

## Development

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pinecone = {
      source ="thekevinwang.com/terraform-providers/pinecone"
    }
  }
}

provider "pinecone" {}
```

## Testing

```console
cp .env.example .env
go test -v ./...
```

## Documenting

This project relies on `./tools/tools.go` to install [`tfplugindocs`](github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/cmd/tfplugindocs).

```console
export GOBIN=$PWD/bin
export PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH
go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/cmd/tfplugindocs
which tfplugindocs
```

Run `tfplugindocs` to generate docs, and preview individual files at https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview

## Releasing

There are a few one time steps that have been done already and will not be covered in this README. See the following footnote for more information. [^release]

[^release]: Docs on publishing: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/publishing#publishing-to-the-registry

To release a new version of the provider to the registry, a new GitHub release needs to be created.
Use the following steps to proceed.

1. Ideally youâ€™re on `main`, and have a clean working tree.
2. Ensure the commit (aka HEAD) you're about to release is tagged.
   - `git tag v0.1.2`
   - `git push origin v0.1.2`
3. Run `goreleaser`: `GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) goreleaser release --clean`
   - This will create a new GitHub release which should be detected by the Terraform registry shortly after.
